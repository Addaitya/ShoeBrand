Link to the project: https://addaitya.github.io/ShoeBrand/

The project works well on mobile, tablet and desktop screens. This project is built with purpose of practice front-end development.
Through this project learnt the development of responsive websites.

**Text stack**: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Code Discription
I have divided css in three files:-

  **heading.css:**  It contains about heading related stuff such as navigation bar, logo and hero-image(red nike shoe image).

  **general.css:** It contains all modification that i made on tags like having no underline on <a> anchor tag (text that constains hyperlink to other website).

  **body.css:** It contains all css of main content of the website.

Here javascript is used only to code sliding menu bar which appears when the website is opened on mobile.
